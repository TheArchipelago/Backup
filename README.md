# tumblr-utils

This is a collection of utilities dealing with Tumblr blogs.

- `tumble.py` creates new posts from RSS or Atom feeds
- `tumblr_backup.py` makes a local backup of posts and images
- `mail_export.py` mails tagged links to a recipient list

These scripts are or have been useful to me over the years.

More documentation can be found in each script's docstring or in
[tumblr_backup.md](https://github.com/bbolli/tumblr-utils/blob/master/tumblr_backup.md).
